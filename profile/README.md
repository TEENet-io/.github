# TEENet

**TEE-based trust and execution layer for high-stakes applications**

TEENet enables verifiable execution, policy-based authorization, approval-aware signing, and auditable automation.

## Why TEENet?

TEE hardware gives you isolated compute. Real systems need more than that.

They also need:

- trusted execution boundaries
- TEE-enforced key isolation and secure key use
- platform-enforced policy control over sensitive actions
- verifiable audit trails

TEENet provides these as a single trust and execution layer, so developers do not have to build and operate them around TEE themselves.

## Core Capabilities

### Verifiable Execution
Run sensitive logic inside TEE-backed environments with hardware-rooted trust.

### TEE-Enforced Key Isolation
Keep keys inside the execution boundary, where applications and operators do not directly access or extract them.

### Policy-Based Authorization
Define which application can use which key and what actions it may perform.

### Approval-Aware Execution
Require approvals before sensitive actions are signed or executed.

### Auditable Automation
Make critical actions traceable with structured records across the execution flow.

## Use Cases

- Treasury and governance workflows
- Secure signing systems
- Oracle-style systems

## Design Principles

- Verify first, then trust
- Separate trust from application logic
- Enforce authorization as infrastructure
- Make sensitive actions reviewable and auditable
